# kanji-quiz

## Project description

A quiz to test your kanji knowledge. You can select Kyoiku kanji from first grade to sixth grade. In each question, four meanings are shown for each kanji. If you guess incorrectly, you can choose from the remaining answer choices. Once the correct answer is selected, more information about the kanji (all meanings, kun readings, on readings, strokes, JLPT) can be retrieved.

The app uses the kanjiapi to load the kanji data. Thanks a lot for that!
